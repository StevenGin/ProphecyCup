			<h1>Prophecy Cup tournament Rules</h1>
		</div>
			<p>All games played must follow Riot League Of Legends Summoner code as well as Prophecy Cup rule set. Prophecy Cups council reserves the right to refuse any application and the interpertation of the rules is to be </p>
			<h2>Roster Limitations</h2>
			<h3>Point System</h3>
			<p>
				A point system is used to determine the ELO of every player which gives each player a fixed score dependent on their current rank. A team is allowed a maximum of 100PCUP points shared between the 5 players that play in an offical Prophecy Cup game. <a href="/students/jhobbs10/prophecy/getstarted/tournament/points.php">Click here to find out more about PCUP point system</a>
				<h2>Roster Format</h2>
				<h3>Team Size</h3>
			<p>Teams can be composed of 10 different players and 1 coach. If a team uses its 10 slots to fill in players, the coach cannot be used in any offical matches.</p>
			<h3>Team Name/Tag</h3>
			<p>
				Teams are permitted a tag (2-4 characters) to represent their team in Prophecy Cup. These tags must be uppercase letters or numbers and must be unique. Team names need to be approved by the council before being used.
				Once the season starts a team cannot change its name.
			</p>
			<h3>Team Ownership</h3>
			<p>Captains and players may only influence one team in Prophecy Cup. This means that sister teams and participating as a coach in one team and a player in another is forbidden.</p>
			<h3>Roster Changes</h3>
			<h4>Requesting a Roster change</h4>
			<p>
				Any roster changes must be requested in our discord server in the &#35;request-pickup-drop discord channel. When requesting a pickup, the captain must be sure to include the ign of the player and their full Discord Name.
				Request will be approved within 24 hours. The council will make an announcement in the &#34;pickup-drop discord channel when the roster change request has been approved. If no announcement is made after 24hrs the council should be
				contacted as soon as possible.
			</p>
			<h4>When players can change teams</h4>
			<p>
				Teams can make roster changes at any time during the season however the roster of the team locks in 24 hours before their next offical match. During the 24 hours a team can request a roster change but they will not be
				approved until the match is over. If a player leaves a team or is let go they must wait 72 hours before joining another team. <strong>Poaching</strong> is considered a serious violation and is subject to sanction. No team member or affiliat of a team may solicit, lure, or make an offer to any team member who is currently on another
				Prophecy Cup team. Players can only join one Prophecy Cup team at a team however players can join any other team that are not affiliated to Prophecy Cup.
			</p>
			<h4>Playoff rosters</h4>
			<p>
				A player that joins Play-ins will not be able to join another team in the regular season for the first three weeks if the team makes it into the Regular season. This rule only applies to the teams already in the Regular Season. If the council thinks that players are being loand to other teams
				solely for securing a spot in the regular season the Council can apply penalties.
			</p>
			<h3>Discord</h3>
			<p>All players must join the Prophecy Cup discord and if a player intentionally leaves the discord server they will be dropped from the team and is subject to the rules above.</p>
			<h3>Alternate Accounts</h3>
			<p>
				You may only use a maximum of two accounts per player and the Council must know about them at all times. If you wish to add a new account, you must message a Council member so that he can add it to the roster page. If the account that is added has a higher rank,
				the rank of that account will be used for futher matches. As with new players a new accounts also take 24 hours before they can be used in an offical match. Penalalties can be applied to a team that does not register their secondary account in time.
			</p>
			<h3>Sandbagging/Smurfing</h3>
			<p>if the councel believes you are sand bagging your rank or just have a much lower rank than you are worth, the council may assign the account a different point value. If found to purposly be hiding your rank the player will face serious consequences.</p>
			<h3>Team Withdrawal</h3>
			<p>If a team decides to quit or gets disqualified, the remaining games will not be played and will be considered forfeits.</p>
			<h3>Emergency Substitutions</h3>
			<p>If a team needs to to use a emergency sub, they need to contact the council. Emergency subs will receive the following penalties.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>First offence: Loss of all bans for first game of series</li>
				<li>Second offence: Loss of all bans for entire series</li>
				<li>Third offence: Loss of first game of three</li>
				<li>No subs can be used past the third offence</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Lobby and Game</h2>
			<h3>Tardiness</h3>
			<p>the playing team mustt fiel 5 players on time on the day of the offical Prophecy Cup game. If a team is late they will receive the following penalties:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>10 min late the team will loss 3 bans</li>
				<li>15 min late the team will have to forfeit a game</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This counter resets for the second game unless an arrangment is made between the two teams. <strong>No Exceptions</strong></p>
			<h3>Between games</h3>
			<p>Each team will have a maximum 5 minute break before the team must be in lobby. If the team is not back before the 5 min break the same rules for tardiness applies.</p>
			<h3>Chat Rules</h3>
			<h4>Bad Manners</h4>
			<p>
				Excessive amound of bad manners is not acceptable in any way. This includes all chat (at all times), or spamming taunt, laugh, emotes. The opposing team are allowed to ask opponents to stop and if the opposing team doesnt stop the Council will penalize the players. Example is typing is all chat for the sole
				goal of tilting the enemy or binding your mastery to your skills.
			</p>
			<h4>Pauses</h4>
			<p>
				Each team has a total of 15 minutes of pause time which can only be used through unintentional disconnects, hardware or software malfunction, physical interference or bug appearance. Once the team reaches 15 minutes the game will be resumed. For the game to start after a pause <strong>both teams</strong> must confirm they are ready. It is forbiddent to pause a game
				in the middle of a skirmish or fight. Council can apply penalties to teams that decide to pause in inappropriate tiems or not resume when time is up.
			</p>
			<h3>Bugs</h3>
			<p>Bugs can happen at any time. When it happens teams affected are allowed to pause the game. A representative from the team affected needs to tag council in &#35;captain-room and follow the following procedures:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>If bug is visable video proof is needed. If a team can not provide video council will force the game to continue.</li>
				<li>Pause needs to happen right after bug. If the pause is made 1 minute or more after the bug has occured the first time the council will not help the team affected.</li>
				<li>
					If the bug is considered "game breaking" the council can offer a remake to the affected team however the council can decide to give the other team the win based of the following conditions:
					<ul>
						<li>
							The game has been played for more than 15 min and
							<ul>
								<li>The difference in gold is more that 33%</li>
								<li>The difference in remaining turrets is more than seven</li>
								<li>The difference in inhibs being down is more than two.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>If the bug is not "game breaking" both teams will be asked to reconnect to game. If the bug still occurs the team can still provide video as proof and a remake will be offered to the affected teams.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Voice channel</h3>
			<p>All teams must be in their respective voice channels in the Prophecy Cup Discord server. Coaches and other players from the team are allowed in the voice channel only during champion select. When the game starts, only the 5 players playing the game are allowed in the voice channel. If a team is caught trying to ghost the stream, use another voice channel or bring more than 5 players during the game, Council will penalize the team. </p>
			<h3>Streaming</h3>
			<p>
				Prophecy Cup casts all of the official games. When a game is being streamed, only casters, one coach per team and a Prophecy Cup Council member can join the lobby. When Prophecy Cup streams a game, no other players can stream it on their own channel. Also, players are allowed to stream their POV. Although, Prophecy Cup is not responsible for any possible ghosting. Anything said in chats out of Prophecy Cup does not represent us and we can sadly not control it or give any punishments regarding that.
			</p>
			<h3>Rescheduling</h3>
			<p>If a team needs to reschedule a game that has already been scheduled, it must be worked out with the other team’s captain. The captain has the right to maintain the original time and not grant a reschedule. </p>
			<h3>Disconnecting</h3>
			<p>When a player unintentionally disconnects, the team is allowed to pause the game until he reconnects to the game. As per pauses rule<p>
				<!--add bookmark -->
				<h3>Disconnecting from Champion Select</h3>
			<p>If a player disconnects from champion select, the team will be given 5 minutes to field the same player or substitute. After those 5 minutes the rule on tardiness will start applying.<!--add bookmark --> The champion select will then restart, and will have to be the same, up to the point of the disconnect happening. </p>
			<h3>Champion Reworks and Major Gameplay Update </h3>
			<p>When a champion is reworked or has his kit majorly updated, Council is allowed to disable the champion during the week following the changes. Council will make an announcement when champions are disabled and will remake one when the champions is available.</p><!--change for website?-->
			<h3>On Purpose Tardiness</h3>
			<p>At all time, if a Council member judges that a team/player is retarding the game on purpose, he can then apply any penalties to the team/player.</p>
			<h3>Order in Lobby</h3>
			<p>At the start of champion select, players are to be in the pick order to clearly indicate their desired lane assignments. That is, from top to bottom: Top, Jungle, Mid, ADC, Sup. Role swaps are allowed in champion select as we consider player’s flexibility and surprising strategies an asset for a team. </p>
			<h3>Placeholders</h3>
			<p><strong>NO PLACEHOLDERS ARE ALLOWED IN THE PLAY-IN TOURNAMENT</strong></p>
			<p>Players may choose a “placeholder” champion if a player does not own a champion a team desires. The team that chose a placeholder will have to follow a strict protocol for it to be approved:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The champion you choose for the placeholder needs to be in the following list: Annie, Kayle, Amumu, Teemo and Garen</li>
				<li>Players of the the team that chooses to use a placeholder need to communicate the actual pick to an active player on the opposing roster right afterwards using the League of Legends private message system or through discord dm.</li>
				<li>The player will be given 3 seconds of the next ban phase to send the message of the actual pick. It is suggested that teams who want to use placeholders message the opposing captain before locking in the placeholder to avoid conflicts afterwards.
				<li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				Time in champion select is valuable.
				If one of these condition is not followed, the team will not be punished accordingly. Each use of an improper placeholder will have a punishment attached to it:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>First offense: Warning</li>
				<li>Second offense: Loss of bans for next game.</li>
				<li>Third offense+: Play with champion that was intended for placeholder.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Definition of Terms</h2>
			<h3>Season</h3>
			<p>Scheduled league play that will occur over an approximately 5-7 week period of time. Each split will consist of three phases: </p>
			<ol>
				<li>Play-In Tournament</li>
				<li>Regular Season</li>
				<li>Play-In Tournament</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>Matchup</h3>
			<p>A set of games in a best of 3 format. </p>
			<h3>Game</h3>
			<p>
				An instance of competition on the Summoner’s Rift map that is played until a winner is determined by one of the following methods, whichever occurs first:
				<ol>
					<li>Completion of the final objective (destruction of a nexus)</li>
					<li>Team Surrender</li>
					<li>Team Forfeit</li>
					<li>Awarded Game Victory</li>
				</ol>
			</p>
			<h3>Disconnection</h3>
			<p>A player losing connection to the game due to problems or issues with the game client, platform, network, or PC. Could also be due to player’s actions (i.e. quitting the game). Any actions of a play	er which lead to a disconnection shall be deemed intentional, regardless of the actual intent of the player.</p>
			<h3>Game Breaking</h3>
			<p>Certain circumstances must be met before a restart may occur. Prophecy Cup must determine that the bug is critical and verifiable. For the bug to be considered critical, the bug must significantly damage a player’s ability to compete in the game situation. The determination of whether the bug has damaged a player’s ability to compete is up to the sole discretion of the Prophecy Cup Council. In order for a bug to be considered verifiable, the bug must be conclusively present and not possibly attributable to player error. If it is believed that a player is attempting to delay reporting of a bug to wait for a possible restart at a more advantageous time, then a restart will no longer be granted. If Prophecy Cup Council determine that the bug is critical and verifiable and that the player followed the pause protocol, then the disadvantaged team will be presented with the option for a restart. If the team accepts, the game will immediately be restarted</p>
			<h3>Council</h3>
			<p>A council member is the advising board to the admin (Rimsky). They will represent the community as a whole and provide their input on matters. The council members will also each have a specialized division of the server.</p>
			<h2>Penalties</h2>
			<p>
				Upon discovery of any Team Member committing any violations of the rules listed above, Prophecy Cup may, issue the following penalties:
				<ol>
					<li>Verbal Warning(s)</li>
					<li>Loss of Side Selection for Current or Future Game(s</li>
					<li>Loss of Ban(s) for Current or Future Game(s)</li>
					<li>Game/Matchup Forfeiture(s)</li>
					<li>Disqualification(s)</li>
				</ol>
				Repeated infractions are subject to escalating penalties, up to, and including,
				disqualification from future participation in Prophecy Cup. It should be noted that penalties may not always be imposed in a successive manner. Prophecy Cup, in its sole discretion, for example, can disqualify a player for a first offense if the action of said player is deemed egregious enough to be worthy of disqualification by Prophecy Cup.
			</p>
			<p>If a player of a team thinks they were unjustly punished for any reason, they can fill out this<!--appeal from added here--> appeal form. The Council will then review the punishment and will give a second verdict,</p>
