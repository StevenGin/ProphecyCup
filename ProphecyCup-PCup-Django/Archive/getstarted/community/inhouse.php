            <h1>Inhouse Rules</h1>
		</div>
            
            <h2>Intro</h2>
            <p>
                A comprehensive set of rules and guidelines put forth by the Prophecy Cup community to see that the integrity of inhouses and it’s players are held to an acceptable standard.  All of these rules are simply a standard. Inhouse Staff will have final say in all matters regarding any issues that may occur.
            </p>
            <h2>Inhouse Lines & Invite Priority</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Inhouse lines may only be posted by Inhouse officials. Anyone posting excessive ‘Fake Lines’ will receive a 3 game Inhouse suspension</li>
                <li>
                    Official Inhouse lines are to be posted as followed;
                    @Inhouse Inhouse 10 slots -----------------------
                    The term Casted implies that the inhouse/Inhouse Match will be streamed to the Prophecy Cup twitch channel.
                    ANY Inhouse Line that is not posted by inhouse staff members are deemed invalid and NOT official Inhouse Lines.
                </li>
                <li>Invite Priority
                    <ul>
                        <li>Invite Priority only takes place once a player has played in more than 1 Casted Inhouse Matches in a row and/or 2 uncasted Inhouse Matches.</li>
                        <li> A new player that has not played in a previous inhouse will take priority over any player that meets this standard starting from the highest rank on the Inhouse Ladder descending. Players that have not played in recent inhouses that requested to be invited within 2 minutes after the inhouse line was posted will receive Invite Priority over the players at the bottom of the line first.</li>
                        <li>
                            Only inhouse staff are permitted to invite players to the game.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Behavioural Standards</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Under no circumstances are there to be any display of racism, discrimination, harassment, extreme in game toxicity, or implications of life threatening suggestions. ANY and ALL violations of this rule will be subject to Punishment in the order that follows
                    <ol>
                        <li>One Week Suspension </li>
                        <li>Three Week Suspension</li>
                        <li>Permanently banned from Inhouses</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            
            <li>Spamming in the Prophecy Cup Discord’s Inhouse text-channel is not allowed. Anyone in violation of this will be warned not to do it again. If the player persist they will have the League of Legends role taken away from them, not enabling them to type or view the Inhouse text channel. Any more violations of this by going into another text channel will result in the kick and/or ban of offending user.</li>
            <li>Any other violation of Behavioral Standards are to be upheld by the Prophecy Cup Moderators and Staff. If you encounter a problem with any staff member harassing you and showing favoritism towards a player getting into Inhouse Games, you are to report them immediately.</li>
            <li>Any and all incidents not reported within a week of happening will be dismissed immediately and will not be up for discussion.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Captains and Pick-up Format</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>At the start of every season captains are decided by SoloQ ranking. Once 20 players have been placed into the Ranked Inhouse Ladder, the top two in the lobby from the Ladder will become captains. If at any point there is only one person that is ranked in the lobby, it will resort back to SoloQ ranking to determine the second captain.</li>
                <li>After both captains have been selected, the 2nd Captain will have side preference.
                    <ol>
                        <li>Team 1 picks One</li>
                        <li>Team 2 picks Two</li>
                        <li>Team 1 picks Two</li>
                        <li>Team 2 picks Two</li>
                        <li>Last pick to Team 1</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>If a player leaves the Team Select must start over once a new player has been found. If both Captains agree, the new player can just replace the player that left if the Captains do not feel a need to restart the entire Picking process over again.</li>
                <li>Players that are smurfing need to notify the Inhouse Official prior to player selection.</li>
                <li>Only the original Team Captain(s) can use a defer for the Inhouse Match.</li>
                <li>
                    Everyone in the inhouse is required to be present in discord. A mic is not necessary, but is heavily encouraged to create a competitive environment.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Champion Select</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>It is imperative that you work as a team to decide what roles you want to play and who you should ban. Incase of any type of situation, the Captain has the final say on who plays what role (unless obvious situations where it’s troll such as putting everyone in a role they don’t play).</li>
                <li>
                    In situations where a player on a team decides they want to play a generally considered troll pick, it will be up to the Team Captain to decide whether or not it is to be allowed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If there is an issue banning a champion, message the Inhouse Official hosting the inhouse and tell them what the ban is supposed to be.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Placeholders are not allowed unless specific permission is granted by the Inhouse Official.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If a player dodges during Champion Select Phase, the following punishments will occur in order;
                    <ol>
                        <li>1 Day ban from inhouses</li>
                        <li>3 Day ban from inhouses</li>
                        <li>1 Week ban from inhouses</li>
                        <li>Permanent ban from inhouses</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>In Game</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Each team is allowed up to 5 minutes in pause time.</li>
                <li>
                    Pauses are not to occur during teamfights outside of laning phase.
                </li>
                <li>
                    No troll pauses.
                </li>
                <li>
                    No Pauses are to be allowed by players in the lane where a fight is occurring.
                </li>
                <li>
                    All players are to play the game to a competitive standard.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In situations where a Player in a Inhouse Game is intentionally feeding, they are to be banned for one month of Inhouse.
                </li>
