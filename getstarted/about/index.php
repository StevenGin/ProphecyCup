                <h2>Where To Start</h2>
                <p>At Prophecy Cup we offer both community and tournament League of Legends play. The best way to start is to join our discord and subscribe to our subreddit. We have staff members always ready to assist you and begin to build your prophecy. Once you join our discord make sure to use the &num;bot-usage chat to add your rank and reffered role. Then introduce yourself so you can start searching for players and captains.</p>

				<h2>How do I play with other players</h2>
                <p>If you'd like to find people to play with, don't hesitate to write a Reddit post or use the &num;looking-for-group and &num;other-games chat. If you'd like to be given a certain role in our discord make sure to message any moderator. If you would like to particiapte in Inhouses make sure to get the "Inhouse" tag so that you get permissions to access voice and chat rooms. When you get pinged by any staff members, make sure to join as fast as possible since spaces are limited.</p>
                <h2>What are the best ways to find a team?</h2>
                <p>The first thing you should do is start chatting with the people of the community, share clips of your gameplay and share your knowledge of the game. Start making a name for yourself so captains think about you when they are recruiting. Head over to the &num;recruitment-players chat to start looking for a team. Make sure to include all the information a captain would need, like your OP.GG and the reasons why they should pick you up over others. Other than that, your only option is to start your own team. If you think you've got what it takes to be a leader, bring your friends over and recruit new players in the server. People are always looking for teams!</p>
                <h2>How do I get involved in the community?</h2>
                <p>We are always looking for help creating a community that everybody enjoys, and there are many roles you can take in the community. You could be a recruiter that always looks to grow the community and bring more people in by advertising on boards. </p>
                <h2>How can I help Prophecy Cup</h2>
                <p>Other than the roles mention above, you can try and become a Coundil member. Council members are active people that work really hard to provide the best community to people from all around North America. We are always looking for new ideas and new members.</p>
                <p>If you have any-suggestions of any sort or any inquiries make sure to contact us by E-mail. There is also the &num;suggestions chat the we view daily.</p>
